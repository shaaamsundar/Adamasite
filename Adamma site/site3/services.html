            <p>BACKGROUND VERIFICATION</p>
            <p>Fudged CVs are common in today's corporate world, making it a challenge for hiring managers to
                ascertain the identity claims of the candidate being recruited. Whether their CV is authentic� their
                qualifications, work experiences and correspondence address stated are true�that they are not a spy
                sent by a competitor to steal sensitive company information, etc. The risks of hiring without proper
                background verification are too high for an organization, but are often ignored. India is on the
                economic boom and millions of dollars of business is outsourced to India. The companies are in
                tremendous pressure to hire in big numbers, due to this pressure many unsuccessful hires arise
                simultaneously and the HR managers spend a lot of their valuable time dealing with the repercussions
                of these unsuccessful hires. A solution to the above mentioned problem leads to the need for
                Employee Background Screening at Adamma.</p>
